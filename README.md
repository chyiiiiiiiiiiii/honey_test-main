Honey e2e testing is an awesome package. After I tried it for a while, I feel it was so easy and helpful for developers, and even not programmers. Just use common sentences and complete them.  Now I will keep following Honey and expect the improvement of new versions.

## Demo

## Weakness
- Common operations do not have enough keywords for testing, like scrolling.
